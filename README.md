# Sudo-s-Home-Lab
Hello Everyone.
This is a home lab project that I have inititated for this winter break. Since I took couple of classes that truely sparked my curiosity about Virtualizations and it's role in a big organzations, I wanted to work on something that would help me gain a depper understanding of how these things are implemented as a whole. In additon to this, with my personal interest with cybersecurity I wanted to test out what I can do with these VM's in place as a home lab.

**Research**
- Searching equipments in budget for setting up this home lab.
- Fining videos and resources to deepen understanding of virtualizations and finding similar projects
- Understanding system specs required for the projects
- Hardware for first attempt:

**Findings and personal objectives**
- With some research(where I still think I have some gaps to fill,still working on it), I have decided to attempt _Grant Collin's Cybersecurity _ Home lab. 
- First of, I have to say this is really cool project that he did. 
- While I reference this project, I am attempting to learn and make some changes to this project as I proceed further ahead.
- I will have to keep going regardless of some topic being completely new to me, this is how I believe I will learn from this project.

**Project Description**





**Current Progress**
- Still trying to research more into this
