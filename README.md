Hello Everyone.
This is a learning environment project that I have initiated. This was on my mind since I took my windows admin class but due to some commitments and other projects, I couldn't divert my attention fully towards this project. This project delves into topics in active directory and Information technology concepts that are used in managing a small to large scale business or a company. With this project all i want to achieve is more curiosity, more failures that i can learn from and to learn how to solve real world IT problems.

**Findings and personal objectives**
- While I reference this some projects that are out on the internt , I am attempting to learn and make some changes to this project and customize it as much as I can as I proceed further ahead.
