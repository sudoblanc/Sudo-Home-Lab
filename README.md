# Sudo-s-Home-Lab
Hello Everyone.
This is a home lab project that I have inititated for this winter break. Since I took couple of classes that truely sparked my curiosity about Virtualizations and it's role in a big organzations, I wanted to work on something that would help me gain a depper understanding of how these things are implemented as a whole. In additon to this, with my personal interest with cybersecurity I wanted to test out what I can do with these VM's in place as a home lab.
